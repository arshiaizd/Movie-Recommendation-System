# AI NLP Project â€“ Spring 2024

Welcome to the official repository for the **AI NLP Project (Spring 2024 Student Version)**. This project serves as a hands-on introduction to modern Natural Language Processing using deep learning and the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is structured as an educational assignment but can be adapted and extended for more advanced applications.

## Project Overview

This project guides students through a typical NLP pipeline for text classification using state-of-the-art transformer models. You will:

- Load and preprocess real-world text data.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT) for a downstream classification task.
- Evaluate model performance with standard metrics.
- Experiment with hyperparameters and analyze results.

The notebook is intended for educational use and supports experimentation, reproducibility, and extension to more complex NLP problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch (1.11+ recommended)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Pandas, NumPy, tqdm, scikit-learn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-nlp-project-spring2024.git
   cd ai-nlp-project-spring2024
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **(Optional) Download or place your dataset in the **``** folder.**

---

## Usage

- Open `AI_NLP_Project_Spring2024_Student_Version.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

- Follow the notebook step-by-step:

  1. Load and inspect the data.
  2. Preprocess and tokenize text.
  3. Define and initialize the model.
  4. Train and validate.
  5. Test and export predictions.

- Customize the model or data pipeline as needed.

---

## Dataset

- The default setup expects data files in CSV format (`train.csv`, `valid.csv`, `test.csv`) with at least a `text` and a `label` column.
- You can adapt the code to other datasets or text classification problems.

---

## Model

- Utilizes transformer-based models from Hugging Face (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert-base-uncased`).
- The classification head is customizable for binary or multi-class problems.

---

## Training & Evaluation

- The training loop uses PyTorch, supporting GPU acceleration if available.
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall.
- Results and predictions are saved to the `outputs/` folder.

---

## Results

- The notebook reports model performance on validation and test sets.
- Use generated outputs for further analysis or as a starting point for research projects.
